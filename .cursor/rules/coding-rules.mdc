The rules used for Vibe coding are as follows:

*   Always prefer simple solutions.
*   Avoid duplication of code whenever possible, by checking for other areas of the codebase that might already have similar code and functionality.
*   Take into account separate Dev, test, and prod environments.
*   Be careful to only make changes that are requested or you are confident are well understood and related to the change being requested; focus on the specific task.
*   When fixing an issue or bug, do not introduce a new pattern or technology without first exhausting all options for the existing implementation, and if you finally do, make sure to remove the old implementation afterwards.
*   Keep the code base very clean and organized.
*   Avoid writing scripts and files if possible, especially if the script is likely only to be run once. If a script is created, either write the script and execute it inline, or delete the file when done.
*   Avoid having files over 200-300 lines of code; refactor at that point.
*   Do not use mock data for Dev or prod, only in test environments; never add stubbing or fake data patterns to code that affects the Dev and prod environments.
*   Do not overwrite the .env file before first asking and confirming.
